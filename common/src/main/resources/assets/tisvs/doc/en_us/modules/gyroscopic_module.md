# Gyroscopic Module

![turns out...](item:tisvs:gyroscopic_module)

The Gyroscopic Module outputs any component of a Quaternion of a Ship's rotation at any given time via half-point precision floats.


If this module is not installed in a casing on a Ship, then all values will return NaN in half-point precision floats.

- qX
Represents and outputs the X value of the Ship's Quaternion representation
- qY
Represents and outputs the Y value of the Ship's Quaternion representation
- qZ
Represents and outputs the Z value of the Ship's Quaternion representation
- qW
Represents and outputs the W value of the Ship's Quaternion representation


These modes can be switched individually by right-clicking the displayed modes when installed.
